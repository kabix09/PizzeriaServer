## Overview
The purpose of writing this project was to get acquainted with REST API technology and Swagger environment as well as to practice using programming patterns and external tools.
The main patterns used in this project are `facade` & `composite`. 
First is used to separate firebase api from the rest of the code and the second was introduced to ensure compliance with the SOLID principles for validator module, especially flexibility in extending the object validators with new features. 

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* [php 8.2](https://www.php.net/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) database
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) annotations
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) server

## Launch
This server application is default setup to run on `localhost:8000` address. To run this project you need `php 7.4` version and an environment capable of correctly handling the `.htaccess` files settings for example with `apache` module to ensure the route module functioning.
Otherwise for database connection it is necessary to add `data/myFirebaseConfig.json` file generated by firebase service.

### Launch on docker
Make sure you have Docker installed. Follow the steps mentioned on the official site if you don't already have it.

1. Pull the repo
2. Open terminal (Git Bash / CMD) in the project directory
3. Run `docker-compose up -d --build` (--build flag would be needed only when one of the dockerfiles in docker-compose.yml have been updated).
4. Dependencies are installed by default
5. Access the project in browser based on vhost setup in apache. 
6. Once done with development, you can run `docker-compose down` which will stop the running containers of your project

**Note**
1. Before running you need to complete `data` folder with file containing data required to connect with firebase database
2. Access on vhost might not work then use custom `localhost` address

### Dependencies
To reinstall dependencies run `docker compose run --rm composer install`

## Features
* Take order from client
* Return pizzeria data to client
* Validate users input
#### To do
* Authenticate user with JWT token

## Sources
This app is inspired by student's project where we got fully functional rest api [server](https://github.com/DzixxxVizlib/UAM-WMI-NFW) providing data to our client application.
